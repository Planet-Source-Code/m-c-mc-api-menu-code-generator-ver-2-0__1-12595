Why API popup menu ? 
-Api menus can exist on borderless form, VB menus can't
-offers much more options as VB menus !
Why not API popup menu ?
-It takes a lot of knowldge, thinking, coding and time.
Solution to the last:

MC API MENU CODE GENERATOR ver 2.0 (Pro)

ver1.0

-it makes API menus code automaticaly - you yust build them like in VB !
-it makes sub-s where you put code to be executed when items selected !

of time & thinking (specialy about submenus) !
